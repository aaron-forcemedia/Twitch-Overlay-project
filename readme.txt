Twitch Overlay Simulator
Aaron Wilson


Internet connection required to view GIFs. This project is a continuation on my first
project from the Code Louisville Front-End class.

The purpose of this site is to simulate a Twitch gaming overlay designed to display 
on screen graphics when twitch users interact with the channel's chat & stream. 
These actions will be displayed in real time as the user interaction occurs. The goal of this
project is to later connect this application with a Twitch API and use in real time. 

To simulate anti-spamming measures each action can only be performed once except for the Get Stats
function which can be used multiple times.

Please enjoy this work in progress. The intended design uses a transparent background and will 
be overlayed onto a livestream of a video game in progress using Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).

Project Requirements met:

--Media Queries adjust menu. Both are designed with different mobile platforms in mind. 
Since this is desinged to be used with OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) the maximized browser 
window is ideal. The vertical viewing option displays GIF & Text in one grid column.

-Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)

-Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, 
and use or display it in your application

-Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts 
cups to grams)

-Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)

-Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines 
a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value
	(Technically the function that makes the API requests takes one parameter and then retrieves a 
variable from the first API and then requests data from a second API using that variable so this may qualify)
